# 1D correlator simulator

What : A script to demo how a single baseline correlator works and how decorrelation (due to delay and bandwidth) manifests in the measured output visibilities.

How : Simulate two time-series, shifted relative to each other to represent radiation incident from a non-vertical direction. 
Implement the multiply and accumulate step of complex correlation and measure a complex visibility. Establish relations between 
channel bandwidth, baseline lengths and delays and demonstrate the appearence of the theoretically expected Sinc response.
